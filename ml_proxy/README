Project: ml_proxy

	A simple proxy server. In the basic form, the proxy will simply forward absolute HTTP requests to the real server
		and return the result to the client/requestor.
	By setting a flag, advanced mode can be enabled. In this case, the proxy server will determine if a request is
		addressed to a locally hosted ml_server. If so, it will use shared memory to return the result, rather than
		the typical TCP stack.
